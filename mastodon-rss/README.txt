Mastodon RSS

What it does:

    It's a Wordpress widget to show Mastodon RSS feeds. 

Technical reason for using this widget

    - Mastodon rss feeds don't use an item title tag.  
    
    - With a 'normal' RSS widget this means that the feed looks something like this:

    (Untitled)
    (Untitled)
    (Untitled)

    Ugly!!

    With this widget your feeds should look more like this:

    I've just installed the Wordpress Plugin, Mastodon-RSS.  Strewth, it's amazing!


Technical reasons for not using this widget 

    This is the first Wordpress plugin.

    It's very basic.

To use:

1. Install by uploading as you would any other wordpress plugin.
2. Activate plugin
3. Go to Appearance->Widgets
4. Add widget to the preferred location.  It's called Mastodon RSS Widget (you'll probably need to search for it)
5. In the widget settings include the RSS feed from Mastodon (it needs to be from Mastodon otherwise it won't work)
6. Update
7. It works! (hopefully).
