# Mastodon RSS

## Aim

 A Wordpress widget to import the rss feed from a Mastodon account and format it correctly so it can be displayed in Wordpress.

 ## Warning

 This is the first release of the Wordpress plugin. It's not available on the Wordpress site and probably never will be.

It's very basic.

## How to Use

1. Install by uploading as you would any other wordpress plugin. You can upload the plugin in zipped format and Wordpress should deal with it fine.

2. Activate plugin

3. Go to Appearance->Widgets

4. Add widget to the preferred location. It's called Mastodon RSS Widget (you'll probably need to search for it).  One of the Sidebars is nice.
    
5. In the widget settings include the RSS feed from Mastodon (it needs to be from Mastodon otherwise it won't work).  It should look something like https://mastodon.instance/@username.rss.  Change the details to match your chosen Mastodon account then add .rss at the end (no space between the username and .rss).  

***Note:*** Every Mastodon account already has a rss feed. You don't need to activate it for this to work.

6. Update

7. It works! (hopefully).
